# restaurant-page

The Odin Project's "Restaurant Page" is a JavaScript-focused project designed to teach the use of Webpack and ES6 modules for organizing code and managing assets. The project involves building a multi-tab restaurant website where content for each tab is dynamically generated using JavaScript and manipulated in the DOM.

# Key Aspects of the project include:
 * # Webpack and ES6 Modules: 
    The core of the project involves using Webpack to bundle JavaScript modules and other assets like CSS and images. ES6 modules are used to structure the JavaScript code into separate, manageable files, which are then imported and exported as needed.

* # DOM Manipulation:
    All content on the restaurant page, including the header, navigation, and content for each tab, is dynamically created and appended to a single div element in the HTML using JavaScript.

* # Tabbed Interface:
    The website requires at least three tabs (e.g., Home, Menu, Contact). Clicking on a tab should dynamically load its corresponding content, which is managed within separate JavaScript modules.

* # Asset Management:
    Webpack is configured to handle various assets, including CSS for styling and images for the page content. Loaders are used to process these assets during the bundling process.

* # Project Setup:
    The project typically starts with setting up a GitHub repository, initializing npm, and installing and configuring Webpack with necessary plugins like html-webpack-plugin. A .gitignore file is used to exclude node_modules and the dist folder from version control.
